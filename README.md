Lecture notes and code for the course ["From free fermions to limit shapes and beyond"](https://bimsa.net/activity/freefermionslimitshapes/)

Video recordings are available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPPPBj3dto2yTNnA5wTMn1TQTCG2bz8aU) and [BIMSA](https://www.bimsa.cn/newsinfo/838135.html) website. This repository contains lecture notes and demonstration code. 

## Introduction:

This course is dedicated to the thorough introduction of the subjects,
mentioned in my talk at [the BIMSA Integrable Systems Seminar](https://researchseminars.org/talk/BIMSA-ISS/1/)

In this course we will start from the infinite-wedge formalism and
boson-fermion correspondence, as described in the Chapter 14 of Victor
Kac's book "Infinite dimensional Lie algebras". We will use this
formalism to derive the limit shape for Young diagrams for the
Plancherel measure, as was done in the works of Andrei Okounkov. Then we
will consider the measures on the diagrams related to the skew Howe
duality. After studying GL(n)-GL(k) skew Howe duality we will consider
other classical series of Lie groups. Connections to the determinantal
point processes, orthogonal polynomials, Riemann-Hilbert problem and
integrable systems will be discussed.

## Audience:
  Graduate, Undergraduate

## Prerequisite

The knowledge of linear algebra and basic methods of analysis (integral
calculus, theory of the function of a complex variable) is required.
Some knowledge of Quantum Mechanics and Statistical Mechanics would be
useful. The knowledge of representation theory of the symmetric group
and Lie groups would be useful.
